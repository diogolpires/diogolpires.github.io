<p>Hi, I'm Diogo! I'm a postdoctoral researcher
  at the <a href="https://sodas.ku.dk/people/" target="_blank">Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science (SODAS)</a>. 
</p>

<p>I'm interested in developing new methodologies for better comparing social interaction networks, applying them both to human and non-human animals. My focus is on understanding and informing aspects of social and biological systems related to social behaviour, structure of social interactions, and mobility.
