title: About

<p>I'm interested in developing modelling tools for studying behaviour emergence, particularly in the context of evolutionary game theory and often incorporating realistic features of complex systems. My focus is on understanding and informing aspects of social and biological systems related to collective action, population structure, and mobility. 
  </p>

<p>I'm currently doing my PhD under the supervision of <a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/mark.broom/index.html#" target="_blank">Mark Broom</a> as part of <a href="https://evogamesplus.eu" target="_blank">EvoGamesPlus</a>, an European consortium focused on the theory and applications of evolutionary game theory.

<p> From February to May 2022, I was a research visitor at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, working under the supervision of Igor Erovenko. 
  <p/>
  
 <p> From April to July 2023, I will be a research visitor at the Medical University of Vienna and the Complexity Science Hub, working under the supervision of Rudolf Hanel.

<p> I received my Master's degree in Engineering Physics (2020) from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, Portugal. My final research project was on The Evolution of Signalling in Adaptive Networks, done under the supervision of Prof. Francisco C. Santos. During that time, I worked as a graduate research assistant for 6 months at the Group on AI for People and Society (GAIPS, INESC-ID) under the project Stochastic Dynamics of Collective Action (STOCA).
