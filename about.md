  Hi! I'm Diogo and I'm a PhD candidate and Marie Curie Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at  <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/diogo-pires" target="_blank">City, University of Londonm</a>.

  My interests are focused on the development of modelling tools for the evolution of behaviour, particularly in the context of evolutionary game theory, incorporating features of real complex systems. I am interested in understanding and informing aspects of social and biological systems related to collective action, population structure and mobility. I am doing my PhD under the supervision of <a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/mark.broom/index.html#" target="_blank">Professor Mark Broom</a>, and as part of <a href="https://evogamesplus.eu" target="_blank">EvoGamesPlus</a>, a broad european consortium focused on the theory and applications of evolutionary game theory.
