I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science (SODAS)](https://sodas.ku.dk/people/). My research is focused on understanding the emergence of social behaviour using a range of computational and mathematical modelling tools from network science, complex systems, evolutionary game theory, stochastic processes, and agent-based models. I am now developing new methodologies to better compare social interaction networks, applying them both to human and non-human animals.

I hold a PhD from [City, University of London](https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk). I have done my thesis on **The evolution of multiplayer cooperation and complex social behaviour in structured and mobile populations** under the supervision of [Mark Broom](http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/mark.broom/index.html), and as part of [EvoGamesPlus](https://evogamesplus.eu), a Marie Skłodowska-Curie consortium focused on the theory and applications of evolutionary game theory.

In January and February 2024, I was a research visitor at the [IMDEA Networks Institute](https://networks.imdea.org) in the Opportunistic Architectures Lab, working with Professor [Vincenzo Mancuso](https://networks.imdea.org/team/imdea-networks-team/people/vincenzo-mancuso/) and Professor [Marco Ajmone Marsan](https://networks.imdea.org/team/imdea-networks-team/people/marco-ajmone-marsan/).

From April to July 2023, I was a research visitor at the [Medical University of Vienna](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/) and the [Complexity Science Hub](https://www.csh.ac.at), working with Professor [Rudolf Hanel](https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/rudolf-hanel/).

From February to May 2022, I was a research visitor at the [University of North Carolina in Greensboro](https://www.uncg.edu), working under the supervision of Professor [Igor Erovenko](https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/igor/). 

I received my Master's degree in Engineering Physics (2020) from [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal. My final research project was on **The Evolution of Signalling in Adaptive Networks**, done under the supervision of [Francisco C. Santos](http://web.ist.utl.pt/franciscocsantos/index.html). During that time, I worked as a graduate research assistant for six months at the Group on AI for People and Society (GAIPS, [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt)) under the project Stochastic Dynamics of Collective Action (STOCA).
